# Diabetes Prediction Using Neural Networks (with Class Balancing and Feature Scaling)

## Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of diabetes in patients using a neural network. It handles imbalanced data with oversampling and scales features for better model performance.

## Dataset
- Features: Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age
- Target: Outcome (0 = Non-Diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)
- Based on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

## Installation / How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/skeleton111222/Diabetes-Prediction
2. Install dependencies (import libraries).
3. Load the dataset and run the model.
